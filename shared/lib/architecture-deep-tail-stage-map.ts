/**
 * Canonical stage map for the Architecture deep-tail (DEEP-only continuation bundle).
 *
 * This is the single source of truth for:
 *   - stage identifiers
 *   - relative directory paths
 *   - artifact kind labels (as used by dw-state)
 *   - API route segments (as used by host/frontend)
 *   - expected artifact suffixes
 *   - missing-artifact gap patterns
 *
 * All consumers that previously hardcoded "architecture/04-implementation-targets" etc.
 * should migrate to importing from this map instead.
 *
 * This file is purely declarative. It does not read the filesystem or import other modules.
